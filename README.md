## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ##

I am studying towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. Alongside my degree, I am an assistant data analyst at <a href="https://www.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/"> Sheffield Solar </a> - A research group based at The University of Sheffield. I have recently worked with Sheffield Solar alongside the Turing Institute and Open Climate Fix on the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/solar-nowcasting-machine-vision">â€˜solar nowcasting with machine visionâ€™</a> project which had a goal of producing an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00739-0">open PV dataset with high coverage across the UK</a> that will have positive knock-on effects in the on-going battle against climate change. My prior responsibilities with Sheffield Solar include the managing, uploading and analysing of PV data on Microgen Database as well as the development of the PV-live interactive regional map back in 2017 which helps to map the regional PV production across the UK.
