## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ##

I am a 2nd year undergraduate student studying towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. Alongside my degree, I am an assistant data analyst at <a href="https://www.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/"> Sheffield Solar </a> - A research group based at The University of Sheffield. I am currently working with Sheffield Solar alongside the Turing Institute and Open Climate Fix on the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/solar-nowcasting-machine-vision">â€˜solar nowcasting with machine visionâ€™</a> project which aims to produce an open PV dataset with high coverage across the UK that will have positive knock-on effects in the on-going battle against climate change. Prior to my current repsonsibility of managing, uploading and analysing PV data on <a href="https://www.microgen-database.org.uk/">Microgen Database</a>, I helped to develop the Sheffield Solar PV-live interactive regional map back in 2017 which helps to map the regional PV production across the UK.
