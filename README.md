## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ##

I am a 2nd year undergraduate student studying towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. Alongside my degree, I am an assistant data analyst at <a href="https://www.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/"> Sheffield Solar </a> - A research group based at The University of Sheffield. I have recently worked with Sheffield Solar alongside the Turing Institute and Open Climate Fix on the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/solar-nowcasting-machine-vision">â€˜solar nowcasting with machine visionâ€™</a> project which aims to produce an open PV dataset with high coverage across the UK that will have positive knock-on effects in the on-going battle against climate change. My prior responsibilities include the managing, uploading and analysing of PV data on <a href="https://www.microgen-database.org.uk/">Microgen Database</a> as well as the development of the Sheffield Solar PV-live interactive regional map back in 2017 which helps to map the regional PV production across the UK.

## Projects ##

### *COVID-19 UK case visualiser* ###

An <a href="http://covidmap.ddns.net:8080/">Angular.js site</a> that visualises the UK's COVID-19 case data on both an interactive map and graph. Uses the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide">Public Health England Python API</a> for the data and uses highcharts and leaflet.js to display it. A <a href="https://github.com/ejones18/nhs_covid_visualiser">data handling script</a> with a CLI was also developed.

### *PV_Live API version 3* ###

The <a href="https://www.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/pvlive/api/">PV_Live web API</a> (Application Programming Interface) provides access to near-real-time and historical estimates of PV generation on the GB transmission network. It returns a computer friendly (JSON) response for use in software, websites, apps etc.
